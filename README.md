# AV Installation Study Guide — LED Video Walls

## About This Repository

This repository is simply a place for me to collect notes, diagrams, terminology, and general research while learning about LED video wall installation. Particularly large format Samsung systems.

I’m very new to this field. This isn’t intended to be a definitive guide or reference for others, but more of a personal learning project. If anything here is useful that's great but first and foremost, this is a workspace for me to structure my thoughts and document what I’m picking up as I go.

The goal of this is not to act like theoretical knowledge is any replacement for real on site implicit learning and experience. I understand installing and working with LED systems properly is a hands on skillset built through practical exposure, potencial mistakes, and working alongside experienced engineers and technicians.

This project exists to fill the gap while I build that experience and to give myself something to refer back to, to stay organised, and to show future employers that I’m taking the learning process seriously while staying aware of my current limitations.

Please expect mistakes and many revisions.
