# AV Installation Notes — Samsung LED Systems

This repository documents my learning journey into professional AV installation — with a focus on large-scale Samsung LED systems (IWA / IFA series) as used by commercial AV integrators.

This is an open, public learning journal designed to capture technical notes, terminology, troubleshooting references, and reflections as I study the field and prepare for work in the industry.

## Why This Exists

I'm at the very beginning of my learning in AV installation. I want to create a resource that shows my process for learning complex systems, breaking down technical documentation, and developing field-ready knowledge.

This isn't a finished guide. It's a log of what I'm learning, how I'm thinking about the work, and where I'm heading next.

## Day 1 Notes: What I Know So Far

- LED Install is modular.
- Work is heavily diagram-based (site diagrams, power/data layouts, cabinet numbering).
- Samsung IWA/IFA series is the current product focus.
- Key processes involve:
  - Frame installation
  - Cabinet mounting
  - Power & signal cabling (Docking or OCM cables)
  - S-Box configuration (signal controller)
  - Testing, calibration, dehumidification

---

## Immediate Learning Priorities

1. Read through the Samsung Installation Manual in stages.
2. Understand LED install terminology:
   - Cabinet
   - Frame Kit
   - Docking
   - OCM Cable
   - S-Box
   - Dehumidification
3. Study common troubleshooting processes (e.g. docking errors, Z-axis adjustment, screen defects).
4. Understand environmental considerations (humidity, condensation, airflow requirements).
