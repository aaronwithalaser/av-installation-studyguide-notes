## System Architecture & Conceptual Diagram (Work In Progress)

This diagram is scoped for theory and system layout only and designed for learning and internal reference.

It is not yet fully complete and several areas require further research, clarification, and refinement before being considered accurate enough for real-world deployment documentation.

### Remaining Work & Research Notes

#### 1. Cabinet Interconnections (Data Link Between Cabinets)

Currently only showing zone-level data link routing.

- Missing: Cab to cab connection within each zone.
- Research:
  - What cable type is used between cabinets? (Samsung proprietary system cable / HDBaseT / Ribbon?)
  - Confirm routing style: Vertical vs Horizontal daisy chain depending on install.

---

#### 2. Power Chain Layout

Currently not shown.

Cabinets are powered independently of the data link.

- Research:
  - How many cabinets per power chain?
  - Power daisy chained between cabinets or direct run from PSU?

---

#### 3. IG (Interface Gender) Specific Behaviour & Limitations

IG noted as passive breakout point.

- Further clarity needed on:
  - How many Primary/Redundant outputs per IG?
  - Does the IG enforce pixel load limits or is this S-Box software managed?
  - Confirm which models integrate IG into Sbox (check IW008C/IWA documentation).

---

#### 4. Data Link Cable Types & Limits

Already noted:
- Media Source to S-Box: HDMI / DP
- S-Box to IG: Fibre (OCM One Connect) / HDBaseT

Missing:
- IG to Cabinets: Cable type?
- Cabinet-to-Cabinet: Cable type?

Research:
- Confirm data link cable specs and max supported length.
- Determine if Samsung use proprietary cables exclusively between cabinets.

---

### Optional Final Pass (Later Stage)

- Add power chain overlays.
- Label cabinet numbers per zone.
- Add cable type legend.
- Confirm module count per cabinet spec.
- Final verification against manufacturer documentation.

This diagram serves as a working learning tool â€” fundamentals first, intricacies layered in later through research and experience.
